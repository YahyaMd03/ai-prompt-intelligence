# Architecture Boundaries

- **api**: Flask blueprints, request/response schemas (Pydantic). No direct DB or Groq calls.
- **application**: Use-cases only. Depends on domain + infrastructure interfaces. No Flask or HTTP.
- **domain**: Entities, enums, validation rules, error types. No imports from api, application, or infrastructure.
- **infrastructure**: Repository, Groq provider, logging. Implements interfaces used by application.

Do not import from a higher layer into a lower layer (e.g. api must not import from application except via clear use-case entry points). Application layer must not import Flask or request objects.
