# Testing and Verification Gate

- New or changed API endpoints must have at least one test in `backend/tests/api/` or `frontend/src/**/*.test.*`.
- New application or domain logic should have unit tests in `backend/tests/unit/` or equivalent frontend tests.
- When fixing a bug, add a test that would have caught it.
- Run `pytest` (backend) and `npm run test` (frontend) before considering a change complete.
