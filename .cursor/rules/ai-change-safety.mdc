# AI-Assisted Change Safety

- All AI-suggested or generated code must be reviewed for correctness and alignment with project rules (architecture, schemas, tests, observability).
- After any generated change, run the relevant tests and linters; fix any regressions before committing.
- Do not commit generated code that skips validation (e.g. disabling type checks or tests) or that introduces hardcoded secrets or placeholder credentials.
- Prefer small, reviewable edits; break large refactors into steps with passing tests between steps.
